# AirBnB clone - RESTful API

In this segment of the AirBnB clone project, we are creating REST APIs using flask

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTPS technologies found in web browsers and servers

By using **Blueprint** we are able to make extendable and scalable code by modulizing and organizing the code in such a way that many flask instances do not need to be created. In this project we will make a blueprint and register it into the flask application
